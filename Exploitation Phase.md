# Exploitation Phase
- When searching for vulnerabilities I always start out looking for low hanging fruit.
## 1. Subdomain Takeover 
### 1.1 Intro
- Searching for subdomain takeovers is one of the easiest vulnerabilities you can find and it normally pays fairly well.
-  A subdomain takeover occurs when a domain is pointing to another domain (CNAME) that no longer exists.
-  If an attacker were to register that non existing domain then the targets subdomain would now point to your domain effectively giving you full control over the target’s subdomain.

### 1.2 Subdomain Takeover
- You should be searching for subdomain takeovers on a daily basis. Just because you checked your target yesterday doesn't mean they are safe today.
- Before you can check for subdomain takeover you need to get a list of your target’s subdomains, this should have been done during the recon phase
- Once you have a list of subdomains checking for this vulnerability should only take about 5 minutes with the following tool:
	-  https://github.com/haccer/subjack
-  ```bash
./subjack -w <Subdomain List> -o results.txt -ssl -c fingerprints.json
- The next step is to see where this domain is pointing to so we can try to take it over
	- ```bash
	dig <Domain Here>
	

### 1.3 Conclusion
- Subdomain takeover is one of the easiest high impact vulnerabilities you can search for. As long as you have a list of subdomains checking for this vulnerability is a matter of running a command. Administrators are constantly changing DNS setting so a company may be safe one day and vulnerable the next because of this it’s a good idea to constantly check for this vulnerability.

## 2. Github
- When performing your initial recon on an organization don’t forget about GitHub. GitHub is used by developers to maintain and share their code, most of the time they end up sharing much more though.

### 2.1 Github Dorks
- GitHub dorks are basically the same thing as google dorks. A dork is used to find specific information in a sea of information. It helps us narrow down the search to exactly what we want.
- This can be very handy when searching for sensitive files, API keys, passwords, and a lot more.
- We can use dorks to find sensitive files that developers might have accidentally uploaded.
	- filename:.bash_history DOMAIN-NAME
- A good list of these dorks can be found below:

### 2.2 Company Github
- Instead of using GitHub dorks to find exposures you might want to go directly to the source. To do this you must find the companies GitHub page and from there you can locate all their developers and monitor their accounts.
- Once you find a company's page you want to get a list of people that are associated with the company. This can be done by clicking on the “people” tab.
- Now you will need to manually go through each one and look for exposures. 
- You should be looking for URLs, api keys, usernames, paswords, vulnerabilities, and anything else that could provide value.

## 3. Misconfigured Cloud Storage Buckets
- Today companies are moving their infrastructure to the cloud as it is more convenient to ent resources from third parties. However, cloud services can be tricky to set up roperly if you don’t know what you’re doing thus people mess things up and introduce vulnerabilities into their environment. 
- One of the most popular vulnerabilities is finding an exposed cloud storage bucket. These buckets are used to store files so depending on what's in the bucket you might have access to sensitive information.
